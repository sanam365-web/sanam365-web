    "The book is fundamentals first by introducing basic programming concepts and techniques
before designing custom classes. The fundamental concepts and techniques of selection
statements, loops, methods, and arrays are the foundation for programming. Building this
strong foundation prepares students to learn object-oriented programming and advanced Java
programming." - Ahmad Ahmady
