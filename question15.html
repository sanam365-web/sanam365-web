    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book teaches programming in a problem-driven way that focuses on problem solving rather than syntax. We make introductory programming interesting by using thoughtprovoking problems in a broad context. The central thread of early chapters is on problem
solving. Appropriate syntax and library are introduced to enable readers to write programs for
solving the problems. To support the teaching of programming in a problem-driven way, the
book provides a wide variety of problems at various levels of difficulty to motivate students.
To appeal to students in all majors, the problems cover many application areas, including
math, science, business, financial, gaming, animation, and multimedia.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book seamlessly integrates programming, data structures, and algorithms into one text.
It employs a practical approach to teach data structures. We first introduce how to use various
data structures to develop efficient algorithms, and then show how to implement these data
structures. Through implementation, students gain a deep understanding on the efficiency of
data structures and on how and when to use certain data structures. Finally we design and
implement custom data structures for trees and graphs
